A = rand(10, 10)
DLA_A = DLAMatrix(A)
lu!(DLA_A) #This will call the getrf Julia code which is the LAPACK code

A = rand(10, 10)
DLA_A = DLAMatrix(A)
lu!(DLA_A, NoPivot()) #This will call generic lu code in julia

What is missing: 
1. lu
2. lu for compelet pivoting using Julia
3. solve div
4. factors L and U
