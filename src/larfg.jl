    larfg!(n, alpha, x, incx, tau)

Generate an elementary reflector H such that:
H * [alpha; x] = [beta; 0]

where H = I - tau * v * v^H, v = [1; x/scale], and beta = -sign(alpha) * ||[alpha; x]||

This routine generates a complex elementary Householder reflector H of order n,
such that when applied to the vector [alpha; x], it zeros out the x portion
and produces [beta; 0] where beta has the same magnitude as the original vector.

# Arguments  
- `n`: Order of the reflector (length of full vector [alpha; x])
- `alpha`: Scalar element, the first component of the vector
- `x`: Vector of length n-1, remaining components of the vector  
- `incx`: Increment for elements of x (typically 1)
- `tau`: Output scalar factor for the reflector

# Returns
- `alpha`: Modified to contain beta (the new first component)
- `tau`: Scalar factor such that H = I - tau * v * v^H

# Algorithm
The algorithm handles potential under/overflow carefully by scaling when
necessary. The reflector is chosen so that the reflection introduces no
unnecessary amplification of round-off errors.

Special cases:
- If x = 0 and imag(alpha) = 0, then tau = 0 (no reflection needed)
- If n â‰¤ 1, then tau = 0 (trivial case)

# Mathematical Details
For the elementary reflector H = I - tau * v * v^H where v = [1; u]:
- tau = (beta - alpha) / beta for real case
- tau = (beta - Re(alpha))/beta - i*Im(alpha)/beta for complex case  
- The vector u replaces x on output

# Note
This is a low-level LAPACK-style computational routine. Input validation
should be performed by higher-level interfaces.

"""
    larfg!(x) -> (alpha, tau, x_updated)

Generate an elementary reflector H such that H * x produces a vector
with all but the first element equal to zero.

This is a high-level interface to the elementary reflector generation routine.
Given a vector x, it computes a Householder reflector H = I - tau * v * v^H
that zeros out all but the first component.

# Arguments
- `x`: Vector to be transformed (will be modified in-place)

# Returns  
- `alpha`: The resulting first component (beta)
- `tau`: Scalar factor of the elementary reflector
- `x_updated`: The updated vector with first component as alpha, rest as reflector vector

# Input Validation
- Vector must have at least one element

# Example
```julia
x = complex.([3.0, 4.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
alpha, tau, x_new = larfg!(x)
# x_new[1] will be the magnitude -||x||, x_new[2:end] will be the reflector vector
```

# Mathematical Background
Creates H such that H * x = [||x||; 0; 0; ...] where the sign is chosen
to avoid cancellation. The reflector vector is stored in x_new[2:end].
